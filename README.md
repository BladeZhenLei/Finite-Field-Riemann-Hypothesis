# Introduction
The famous Riemann hypothesis is closely related to the distribution of primes. In graph theory, by defining prime paths, a graph is said to be Ramanujan if and only if its Ihara zeta function satisfies an analogy of the Riemann hypothesis. The concept of graph Riemann hypothesis was first introduced by A.A.Terras.
The Ihara zeta function [1] is used to describe a a finitely connected  regular graph $X$,  defined as
\[\zeta_X\left(u\right)=\prod_{\left[C\right]}{({1-u^{v\left(C\right)})}^{-1}},\]
where $u$ is a sufficiently small complex number, and the infinite product is over all $[C]$ of primes in $X$.
