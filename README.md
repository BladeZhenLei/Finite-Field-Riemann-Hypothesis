# Introduction
The famous Riemann hypothesis is closely related to the distribution of primes. In graph theory, by defining prime paths, a graph is said to be Ramanujan if and only if its Ihara zeta function satisfies an analogy  $[1]$ of the Riemann hypothesis. The graph Riemann hypothesis was first introduced by A.A.Terras $[2]$.}
